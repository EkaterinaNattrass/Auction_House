### Contributing 

I welcome contributions to the project and appreciate your interest in improving it!

## Heroku deployment

The app is deployed to Heroku at [https://noroff-auction-house-80f72f8a1683.herokuapp.com/](https://noroff-auction-house-80f72f8a1683.herokuapp.com/). Heroku was chosen over Netlify or GitHub Pages because the application relies on a backend built using Express, making Heroku more suitable for hosting dynamic server-side logic alongside static files.
